 *
 * 	@brief Tasks that write and read to MIL-STD-1553B bus
 *
 *  The MIL-STD1553 standard supports three different kind of devices: Remote 
 *  Terminal, Bus Controller and Bus Monitor.
 *  The bus controller interface is different from the other interfaces in
 *  the IO Partition. A bus controller is responsible for controlling every 
 *  data transaction in the bus. There are other operations that do not involve
 *  data transactions which are used to reset devices or to stop the bus.
 *	The BC interface has to provide means to create Mil-Std1553b commands for
 *  any type of operations. 
 *	The other big difference between the BC interface and other interfaces is 
 *  that you can't read data directly; you must first issue a data read command
 *  into the bus.
 *
 *  To accommodate the BC mode onto the current IOP interfaces (request/reply
 *  and remote ports) the following behavior was defined:
 *      - In BC mode, a device is defined by its RT address and a subaddress
 *  	- Write requests will generate a data write command to a device
 *      - Read requests will generate a data read command to a device
 *		- Destination remote ports will generate a data read command in every 
 *		  IOP execution window.
 *		- Source remote ports will generate a data write command wherever data 
 *		  is written onto them.
 *		- A new operation, named CONTROL, is created. A control operation enables
 *        the user to create a list of commands that is processed directly by
 * 		  Bus Controller without any kind of routing.
 *
 *
 *	For more information on the CONTROL operation please consult #struct bc_msg
 *  documentation.
