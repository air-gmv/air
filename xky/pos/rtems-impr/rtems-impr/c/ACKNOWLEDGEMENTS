RTEMS was developed by On-Line Applications Research (OAR) under
contract to the U.S. Army Missile Command.  Other than the
contributions listed in this document, all code and documentation
was developed by OAR for the Army.

The RTEMS project would like to thank those who have made
contributions to the project.  Together we make RTEMS a
much better product.

The following persons/organizations have made contributions:

+ Dr. Mikhail (Misha) Savitski (mikhail.savitski@styrex.se) of the EISCAT
  Scientific Association submitted the BSP and other miscellaneous support
  for the Motorola MVME162 (M68040LC CPU) VMEbus single board computer.

+ John S. Gwynne (jsg@coulomb.eng.ohio-state.edu) of Ohio State University 
  submitted the support for the Motorola MC68332 CPU as well as completing 
  the support for CPUs based on the MC68000 core.  Although the BSPs for
  automotive electronic fuel injection (EFI) control he submitted have now
  been removed, they formed the foundation for the mrm332 BSP which is still
  in the tree. 

+ The European Space Agency for sponsoring On-Line Applications Research 
  to port RTEMS to the SPARC V7 architecture for use with their ERC32
  radiation-hardened CPU.  Jiri Gaisler (jgais@wd.estec.esa.nl) deserves
  special thanks for championing this port within the ESA was well as
  for developing and supporting the SPARC Instruction Simulator used to 
  develop and test this port.

+ Eric Norum (eric@skatter.usask.ca) of the Saskatchewan Accelerator
  Laboratory submitted the support for the Motorola MC68360 CPU
  including the `gen68360' BSP.

+ Dominique le Campion (Dominique.LECAMPION@enst-bretagne.fr), for
  Telecom Bretagne and T.N.I. (Brest, France) submitted the BSP for
  the Motorola MVME147 board (68030 CPU + 68881 FPU) and the MVME147s
  variant of this board.

+ Craig Lebakken (lebakken@minn.net) and Derrick Ostertag
  (ostertag@transition.com) of Transition Networks of Eden Prairie, MN
  for porting RTEMS to the MIPS and AMD 29K architectures.  This submission
  includes complete support for the R4650 as well as partial support
  for the R4600.

+ Jiri Gaisler (jgais@wd.estec.esa.nl) converted RTEMS to using GNU
  autoconf.  This effort is greatly appreciated.

+ Eric Norum (eric@skatter.usask.ca) of the Saskatchewan Accelerator
  Laboratory submitted a BSP for the m68360 when operating in companion
  mode with a m68040 and a port of the Motorola MC68040 Floating Point
  Support Package (FPSP) to RTEMS.

+ Eric Norum (eric@skatter.usask.ca) of the Saskatchewan Accelerator
  Laboratory submitted a port of the KA9Q TCP/IP stack to RTEMS as
  well as a network device driver for the gen68360 BSP.  To address
  performance issues and licensing concerns, Eric followed this up
  by replacing the KA9Q TCP/IP stack with a port of the FreeBSD stack.

+ Katsutoshi Shibuya (shibuya@mxb.meshnet.or.jp) of BU-Denken Co., Ltd. 
  (Sapporo, Japan) submitted the extended console driver for the 
  MVME162LX BSP and the POSIX tcsetattr() and tcgetattr() routines.
  This device driver supports four serial ports, cooked IO, and 
  provides a portable base for Zilog 8530 based console drivers.

+ Eric Norum (eric@skatter.usask.ca) and Katsutoshi Shibuya
  (shibuya@mxb.meshnet.or.jp) jointly developed the termios support.

+ Ralf Corsepius (corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de) of the Research Institute for
  Applied Knowledge Processing at the University of Ulm (FAW), Germany,
  for numerous enhancements to the RTEMS autoconf support as well as
  for the Hitachi SH port.  His contributions are too many to list but
  also include work on RPMs for RTEMS tools.

+ David Fiddes <D.J.Fiddes@hw.ac.uk>, Rod Barman (rodb@ptgrey.com) and
  Stewart Kingdon (kingdon@ptgrey.com) submitted Motorola ColdFire
  support.  This work was supported in part by Real World Interface, Inc.

+ Charles Gauthier <Charles.Gauthier@iit.nrc.ca> of the Institute for
  Information Technology for the National Research Council of Canada
  submitted the Motorola MVME167 BSP.

+ Jay Kulpinski (jskulpin@eng01.gdds.com) of General Dynamics Defense
  Systems (Pittsfield, MA) submitted a board support package for the
  Motorola MVME230x PowerPC family, borrowing from the PSIM and MPC750
  BSPs.  This includes support for the Raven ASIC, DEC21140 ethernet, 
  16550 serial port, and MK48T59 NVRAM.

+ Eric Valette <valette@crf.canon.fr> and Emmanuel Raguet <raguet@crf.canon.fr>
  of Canon CRF - Communication Dept for numerous submissions including
  remote debugging on the i386 and PowerPC, port of RPC, port of the
  GoAhead web server, port of RTEMS to the ARM architecture, 
  BSP for the Motorola MCP750 PowerPC board, and numerous improvements
  to the i386 and PowerPC ports of RTEMS including a new enhanced
  interrupt management API that reduces interrupt latency while making
  it easier to support external interrupt controllers.

+ Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com> for the BSPs that work with 
  numerous simulators. Many work with instruction set simulators
  in gdb.

+ John Cotton <jcotton@ualberta.ca> and Charles Gauthier
  <Charles.Gauthier@nrc.ca> of the Institute for Information
  Technology for the National Research Council of Canada
  submitted the RTEMS Cache Manager.

Finally, the RTEMS project would like to thank those who have contributed
to the other free software efforts which RTEMS utilizes.  The primary RTEMS
development environment is from the Free Software Foundation (the GNU
project).  The "newlib" C library was put together by Cygnus and is
a collaboration of the efforts of numerous individuals and organizations.

We would like to see your name here.  BSPs and ports are always welcome.
Useful libraries which support RTEMS applications are also an important
part of providing a strong foundation for the development of real-time
embedded applications and are welcome as submission.
