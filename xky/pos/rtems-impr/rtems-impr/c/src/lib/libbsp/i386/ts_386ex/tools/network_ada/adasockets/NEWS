* New in AdaSockets 0.1.3

** Support for IP multicast

The package Sockets.Multicast can be used to create Multicast
interfaces on machine that support it.

** Interface changes

Some functions have been transformed into procedures to ease the
addition of multicast sockets.

** New example

The multi example can be used as both a multicast sender and receiver.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.2

** Warning suppressed

Some versions of GNAT were detecting incorrectly a missing raise in
some cases. Signaled by Nicolas Ollinger <Nicolas.Ollinger@ens-lyon.fr>.

** New example

A listener example which is only a server has been added to avoid any
confusion between clients and servers. Suggestion by Scott Moody
<scott@plato.ds.boeing.com>.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.1

** `aux' -> `support'

The subdirectory `aux' in the distribution has been renamed into
`support' to avoid a name clash on Windows NT with the standard
peripherical `aux'. Suggestion from Juanma Barranquero
<barranquero@laley-actualidad.es>.

** Better error messages

Exception raised during the connection now have messages in many cases 
explaining why the connexion could not be made.
