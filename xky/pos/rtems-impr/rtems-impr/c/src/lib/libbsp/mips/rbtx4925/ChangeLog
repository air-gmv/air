2011-02-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.68, automake-1.11.1.

2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: Many files were duplicated across MIPS
	BSPs. Now those which were directly copied are shared.
	* liblnk/lnklib.S, liblnk/pmon.S, liblnk/regs.h, startup/idtmem.S:
	Removed.

2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* configure.ac: rbtx4925, rbtx4938, and hurricane had very similar
	versions of exception. Now all use shared/irq/exception.S

2010-05-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: rbtx4925 and rbtx4938 had copies of the same file with
	only minor differences. Both now use shared/irq/exception.S
	* startup/exception.S: Removed.

2010-04-27	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Revert previous change. Remove .reginfo from .bss
	section where it was present.

2010-04-25	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrilL@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add NOLOAD to .bss to eliminate warnings.

2010-04-24	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* start/start.S: Verify boot_card is invoked properly with argc, argv.

2009-11-16	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove nested externs.
	#include <libcpu/isr_entries.h.

2009-10-21	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* make/custom/rbtx4925.cfg: Remove RTEMS_BSP_FAMILY.

2009-10-20	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Don't add -ansi -fasm to CFLAGS.

2009-10-15	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* make/custom/rbtx4925.cfg: New (relocated from /make/custom).

2009-09-15	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Remove RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS.

 2009-07-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* configure.ac: Rename BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS to
	RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS. Add RTEMS_BSP_CLEANUP_OPTIONS so all BSPs
	have the same options.

2009-04-28	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* start/start.S: Update for boot_card command line change.

2009-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1385/cpukit
	* startup/exception.S: When the type rtems_boolean was switched to the
	C99 bool, the size changed from 4 bytes to 1 byte. The interrupt
	dispatching code accesses two boolean variables for scheduling
	purposes and the assembly implementations of this code did not get
	updated.

2008-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* bsp_specs: Move -e start from *link to *startfile to avoid warning
	for undefined entry symbol when linking relocatables with binutils
	2.19.

2008-10-02	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: Use shared tm27.h stub.

	* Makefile.am: Reflect changes above.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Eliminate bsp.am. Build startup files as side-effect 
	of building libbspstart.a, using automake-rules.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* liblnk/regs.S: Remove (Renamed into liblnk/regs.h).
	* liblnk/regs.h: New (Renamed from liblnk/regs.S).
	* Makefile.am, liblnk/pmon.S: Reflect renamer.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Eliminate *_SOURCES.

2008-09-29	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Move noinst_LIBRARIES = libbsp.a before its
	components.

2008-09-26	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Cleanup ../../shared/include/bootcard.h handling.

2008-09-23	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* configure.ac: Make letting boot_card() handle work area allocation
	mandatory. Rename RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION to
	BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS.

2008-09-23	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* startup/bspclean.c: Removed.

2008-09-18	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Remove unnecessary boilerplate comments.

2008-09-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/linkcmds: Use top level shared
	bsp_get_work_area() implementation.
	* startup/bspgetworkarea.c: Removed.

2008-09-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove unnecessary includes of
	rtems/libcsupport.h and rtems/libio.h.

2008-09-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, startup/bspstart.c: Create
	bsp_get_work_area() into its own file and use BSP Framework to
	perform more initialization.
	* startup/bspgetworkarea.c: New file.

2008-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Review of all bsp_cleanup() implementations. In this
	phase, all prototypes were removed from bsp.h and empty
	implementations were removed and made to use the shared stub.

2008-09-05	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* console/console-io.c: Convert to "bool".

2008-05-15	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add capability for bootcard.c BSP Initialization
	Framework to ask the BSP where it has memory for the RTEMS Workspace
	and C Program Heap. These collectively are referred to as work area.
	If the BSP supports this, then it does not have to include code to
	split the available memory between the two areas. This reduces the
	amount of code in the BSP specific bspstart.c file. Additionally, the
	shared framework can initialize the C Library, call
	rtems_debug_enable(), and dirty the work area memory. Until most/all
	BSPs support this new capability, if the BSP supports this, it should
	call RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION from its configure.ac.
	When the transition is complete, this autoconf macro can be removed.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field from CPU Table to
	Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all ports. Delete
	references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-04-09	Ralf Corsépius	<ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove --oformat=... 
	Use old_link for -qrtems (Prevents *.link from killing endianness).

2007-04-06	Ralf Corsépius	<ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove lib (Now expected to exist in GCC).

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console-io.c, startup/exception.S: Correct license URL and/or
	fix mistake in copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be
	from code submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-03-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1227/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Remove MAX_LONG_TEST_DURATION and
	MAX_SHORT_TEST_DURATION. They are obsolete and unused.

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* include/.cvsignore: New file.

2006-03-16	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* liblnk/pmon.S, liblnk/regs.S, liblnk/lnklib.S,
