This BSP is for the Technologic Systems TS-1325, an i386EX PC/AT
compatible SBC equipped with 2 standard serial ports and a parallel
port suitable for general digital I/O. It comes with 2MB RAM and 1MB
Flash ROM. Additional information is available at the TS web site:
http://www.t-systems.com.

The BSP uses software floating-point emulation, so one must build the
cross-compilation tools with this support. The BSP also supports the
on-board RTC, and an NE2000 compatible network card. It has been used
successfully with C/C++ (egcs-1.1.2) and Ada95 (gnat-3.11p), including
networking applications.

The TS-1325 runs a version of DOS, and should be configured with a RAM
disk and Zmodem software (see WWW site). RTEMS executables are loaded
and run in DOS conventional memory, giving a 600K file-size limit. The
1MB extended memory is used for the RTEMS workspace, heap, stack and
BSS. Console output is to COM2 @ 115200 baud, 8-N-1. The high baud
rate is needed to speed up serial-line Zmodem file transfers. The
TS-1325 DOS console I/O is by default 9600 baud, and should be changed
to 115200 baud (see WWW site).

A typical development cycle involves these steps:

1. Cross-compile the application, yielding an ELF executable. Convert
   this to raw binary format, using objcopy or the elf2exe script (see
   the tools subdirectory in the BSP).

2. Use Zmodem to download the raw executable to the TS-1325's ram-disk
   (faster than  the A: flash disk). A terminal program supporting
   Zmodem is needed on the host e.g. minicom under Linux.

3. Use the DOS-based RTEMS loader "loader.com" (see tools
   subdirectory) to load and run the executable on the TS-1325.

Additional documentation and support software is in the tools subdirectory
of the BSP.

Happy Coding!
