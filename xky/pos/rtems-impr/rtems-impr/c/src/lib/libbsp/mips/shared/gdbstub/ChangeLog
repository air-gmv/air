	PR 433/tools
	* mips-stub.c: Patch from C. M. Heard <heard@pobox.com> described as:

	The purpose of the patch is to make the stub ignore all
	characters except '+' (ack) or '-' (nak) when it has transmitted a
	packet and expects an acknowledgment. Without the patch,
	putpacket() will retransmit each time it receives anything other
	than '+' when expecting an ack, and that, bitter experience has
	found, frequently results in the stub failing to sync up when
	initially attaching to gdb.

	I think that rtems users will notice significant improvement in
	the of the mips stub if this patch is incorporated in the
	distribution; certainly I did in my stand-aline environment. I
	should hasten to add that it is only an improvement and not a 100%
	cure for synchronization problems because '+' characters can (and
	do) during as message data, and it's still possible for these to
	be mistaken as acks. I have no idea how to fix that short of
	redesigning the gdb-remote protocol.

2002-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* mips-stub.c: Removed warnings.

2002-10-02	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* rtems-stub-glue.c: Removed should only be common copy.

2002-08-14	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* mips-stub.c: Re-debugged a breakpoint problem, zbreak target
	address was a char * which caused the target instruction to not
	be fully copied, so the zbreak logic corrupted the original 
	instruction and didn't insert a valid break instruction.

	* mips-stub.c: Removed warnings.

2002-03-05	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* mips-stub.c: Debugged & tweaked the gdb command processing,
	zbreak stuff, breakpoint and step code.  Implemented 'T' command
	support and debugged remote gdb support w/ the Mongoose bsp.
	Added the memory segment support.
	* memlimits.h: Disabled all contents in favor of memory sement
	support.  This file could probably go away.
	* rtems-stub-glue.c (rtems_gdb_index_to_stub_id()): New routine.
	rtems_gdb_stub_get_register_from_context(): Implemented MIPS version.
	rtems_gdb_stub_get_offsets(): Implemented MIPS version.
	* README: Updated.

2002-03-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: Corrected previous entry. 

2002-02-27	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* mips-stub.c: Modified isr install routine to
	capture all exceptions.

2001-02-27	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Significant modifications including adding thread support, the 'X'
	command, and reorganizing so that target CPU independent routines
	could be reused.
	* gdb_if.h: Added numerous prototypes.
	* mips-stub.c: Added thread support as well as 'X' command.
	Also noticed that the 'P' command was from the mips protocol.
	* rtems-stub-glue.c: New file.  This file contains all generic
	support which should be able to be reused on another target CPU.

2002-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* mips-stub.c (handle_exception): Prototype changed to be an RTEMS 
	entry point.  Added comments about possible need to flush cache.
	(mips_gdb_stub_install): New routine.

2002-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile, stubinit.S, r46kstub.ld, ioaddr.h: Removed as unused
	with RTEMS.
	* r46kstub.c: Renamed to mips-stub.c.
	* mips-stub.c: New file -- was r46kstub.c.
	* memlimits.h: New file was limits.h.
	* limits.h: Removed.
	* r4600.h: Eliminated need for this file.
	* README: Updated.
 	* gdb_if.h: Added CVS Id.
	* mips-stub.c: Attempt to deal with MIPS1 versus MIPS3.

2002-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Merged r46kstub.c into RTEMS distribution without modification.
	I got the code from Franz Fischer <Franz.Fischer@franz-fischer.de>
	who had used this with an old version of RTEMS with the mips64orion
	port of RTEMS.  After adding this to the repository, I will tailor
	this to work with the RTEMS exception processing model and trim
	no longer needed parts.
	* ChangeLog, gdb_if.h, ioaddr.h, limits.h, Makefile, mips_opcode.h,
	r4600.h, r46kstub.c, r46kstub.ld, README, stubinit.S:

Sun Sep 29 16:34:53 1996  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Updated snapshot posted.

	* stubinit.S (_reset_exception, _general_exception): Reorder
	instructions or insert nops as necessary to ensure that the
	target register of mfc0, mfc1, and cfc1 instructions is not
	used as a source register in the load delay slot of those 
	instructions and to ensure that the instruction following
	mtc0 is always something other than mfc0.  Insert .eject
	directives and reformat some of the comments to make the
	assembler listing more readable.

	* ioaddr.h:  add comments pointing out implementation-
	specific address definitions.

	* limits.h:  add comments describing what the implementation-
	specific macros in this file are supposed to do. 

Tue Aug 06 14:43:04 1995  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Updated snapshot posted.

	* stubinit.S (_general_exception): Use virtual adresses from
	kseg0 (cached, unmapped space) instead of kseg1 (uncached,
	unmapped space) in cache instructions.
	(_reset_exception): Likewise, and use the right
	mask to clean the K0 field in the config register.

Fri Jul 26 14:41:49 1995  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Initial snapshot posted.
