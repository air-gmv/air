#  The Lattice Mico32 port uses the system_config.h generated by the Mico
#  System Builder to retrieve the properties of the peripherals.
#
#   Implemented (in shared/ subdirectory)
#     Polled console driver (uart)
#     Clock interrupt with 10 ms tick
#     Networking using Lattice tri-speed ethernet MAC
#
#   Todo
#     Support more peripherals:
#       - uart driver using interrupts
