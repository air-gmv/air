This board support package works with the uti386ex, designed and built in
house at the University of Toronto.  It should also be compatible the an
Intel Evaluation board. 

There are no decisions to be made at link time. The BSP reserves ALL
available space between the end of the bss section and the start of the
RTEMS Workspace for the heap.  If you wish to add network support, then
you will not need to modify the heap size. 
  

See startup/linkcmds and bsp_start.c for details. 

The clock is generated from an internal i386ex timer counter.  The console
uses COMM2 -- configured as 9600 n,8,1.  COMM1 is available, also
configured as 9600,n,8,1. 

In general, all modification needed to support another i386ex based
platform should be restricted to start.s.  Since there is no real-time
clock on the Intel eval board, if RTclock support is required, then adding
rtclock driver support is necessary. 

Hope this helps!
