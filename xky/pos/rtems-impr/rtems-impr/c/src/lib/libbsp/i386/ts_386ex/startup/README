The requirements for this BSP are only that the GAS used supports the
.code16 directive.  The GAS released with any GCC version 2.8.0 or better
is required.  The BSP was built with an egcs snapshot pre-1.0.2 and
post-1.0.1.  However, any egcs should work. 


The only "real" differences are in bspstart.c, where the initialization now
configures all available RAM, (after setting up the Workspaces) as heap. 
The location of the stack was changed so that the heap was not trapped
between low memory and the stack; the stack comes before the heap.
