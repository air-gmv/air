The following are targets for the GNU tools (gcc, binutils, newlib, and gdb)
that are for RTEMS, their object format, and status notes

arm:
        arm-rtems               ELF

c4x:
        c4x-rtems               COFF           Requires patches

h8300:
        h8300-rtems             COFF

i386:
	i386-rtems		ELF

m68k:
	m68k-rtems		ELF


mips:
	mips*-rtems		ELF		Big endian
	mips*el-rtems		ELF		Little endian

	NOTE: Little endian configuration is not in all tools and 
	      is untested for RTEMS itself.

nios2: 
    nios2-elf           ELF     Little endian

    NOTE: Currently there is no native nios2-rtems toolchain;
      Altera's nios2-elf-tools can be used with wrapper scripts.

powerpc:
	powerpc-rtems		ELF
	powerpcle-rtems		ELF		Little endian

	NOTE: Little endian configuration is not in all tools and 
	      is untested for RTEMS itself.

sh:
	sh-rtems		COFF
	sh-rtemscoff		COFF
	sh-rtemself		ELF

	NOTE:  ELF is not completely stable for SH yet.

sparc:
	sparc-rtems		ELF
