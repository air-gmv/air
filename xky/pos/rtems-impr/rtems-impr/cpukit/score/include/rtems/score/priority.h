 * priorities.  The actual priority of a thread is an aggregation of priority
 * nodes.  The thread priority aggregation for the home scheduler instance of a
 * thread consists of at least one priority node, which is normally the real
 * priority of the thread.  The locking protocols (e.g. priority ceiling and
 * priority inheritance), rate-monotonic period objects and the POSIX sporadic
 * server add, change and remove priority nodes.
