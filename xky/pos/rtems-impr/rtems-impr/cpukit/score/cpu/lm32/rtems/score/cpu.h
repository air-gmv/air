 * @defgroup CPUContext Processor Dependent Context Management
 *
 * From the highest level viewpoint, there are 2 types of context to save.
 *
 *    -# Interrupt registers to save
 *    -# Task level registers to save
 *
 * Since RTEMS handles integer and floating point contexts separately, this
 * means we have the following 3 context items:
 *
 *    -# task level context stuff::  Context_Control
 *    -# floating point task stuff:: Context_Control_fp
 *    -# special interrupt level context :: CPU_Interrupt_frame
 *
 * On some processors, it is cost-effective to save only the callee
 * preserved registers during a task context switch.  This means
 * that the ISR code needs to save those registers which do not
 * persist across function calls.  It is not mandatory to make this
 * distinctions between the caller/callee saves registers for the
 * purpose of minimizing context saved during task switch and on interrupts.
 * If the cost of saving extra registers is minimal, simplicity is the
 * choice.  Save the same context on interrupt entry as for tasks in
 * this case.
 *
 * Additionally, if gdb is to be made aware of RTEMS tasks for this CPU, then
 * care should be used in designing the context area.
 *
 * On some CPUs with hardware floating point support, the Context_Control_fp
 * structure will not be used or it simply consist of an array of a
 * fixed number of bytes.   This is done when the floating point context
 * is dumped by a "FP save context" type instruction and the format
 * is not really defined by the CPU.  In this case, there is no need
 * to figure out the exact format -- only the size.  Of course, although
 * this is enough information for RTEMS, it is probably not enough for
 * a debugger such as gdb.  But that is another problem.

 * The following routine swaps the endian format of an unsigned int.
 * It must be static because it is referenced indirectly.
 *
 * This version will work on any processor, but if there is a better
 * way for your CPU PLEASE use it.  The most common way to do this is to:
 *
 *    swap least significant two bytes with 16-bit rotate
 *    swap upper and lower 16-bits
 *    swap most significant two bytes with 16-bit rotate
 *
 * Some CPUs have special instructions which swap a 32-bit quantity in
 * a single instruction (e.g. i486).  It is probably best to avoid
 * an "endian swapping control bit" in the CPU.  One good reason is
 * that interrupts would probably have to be disabled to ensure that
 * an interrupt does not try to access the same "chunk" with the wrong
 * endian.  Another good reason is that on some CPUs, the endian bit
 * endianness for ALL fetches -- both code and data -- so the code
 * will be fetched incorrectly.
 *
 * @param[in] value is the value to be swapped
 * @return the value after being endian swapped
