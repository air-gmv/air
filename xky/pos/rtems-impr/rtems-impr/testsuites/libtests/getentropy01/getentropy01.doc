This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: random01

directives:

  getentropy

concepts:

  Ensure that getentropy() works with different sizes of arrays and delivers
  different values on multiple calls. It is mainly a check that the function
  does anything at all and does not write over the end of the buffer.

  Note that this test doesn't check any quality of the random numbers. If you
  need some reliable information about quality you should use something like the
  Diehard tests.
