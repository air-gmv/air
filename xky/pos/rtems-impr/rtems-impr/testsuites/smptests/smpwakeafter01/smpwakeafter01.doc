This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: smpwakeafter01

directives:

  - rtems_task_wake_after()

concepts:

  - Ensure that rtems_task_wake_after() works on multiple processors with some
    tasks using different intervals.
  - Use a scheduler partition for processor 1, assign all remaining processors
    to a cluster.  This highlights dependencies on the scheduler instance lock
    in case this test is run with profiling enabled.
