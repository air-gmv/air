 * \brief Contains the routines to perform a partition core context save
 *        and partition core context restore on a ARMv7
 *
 * The context save/restore is handled in exception_irq.S and schedule.c,
 * and because only one ISF needs to be saved, the only thing happening here
 * is the save/restore of additional fields besides the general-purpose
 * registers, such as the MMU and GIC registers.
