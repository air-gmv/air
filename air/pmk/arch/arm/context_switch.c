 * \brief Contains the routines to perform a partition core context save
 *        and partition core context restore on a ARMv7
 *
 * The context save/restore is handled in exception_irq.S and schedule.c,
 * and because only one ISF needs to be saved, the only thing happening here
 * is the save/restore of additional fields besides the general-purpose
 * registers, such as the MMU and GIC registers.

/**

 * The context save is performed in the exception_irq.S (only one ISF needs
 * to be saved). The change is then handled by the pmk_partition_scheduler(),
 * so nothing really happens here.

 * \note the core context shouldn't be trashed at this point
