						Define a test where the MMU tables (L1, L2, L3) are overwritten by a
			supervisor partition (with no additional pages mapped and the MMU enabled).
			Check that this attempt is unsuccessful, and the event is captured and
			handled by the HM, and the associated HM action is called. Test if the
			remaining partitions continue to execute.
