						Call the SET_MODULE_SCHEDULE function from an authorized partition
			and check that the partitioning schedule is altered starting at the next
			major time frame (MTF) start (with GET_PARTITION_MODE). Check that a call
			to SET_MODULE_SCHEDULE with the current schedule produces no change.
			Check that the call from a non-authorized partition fails with an HM
			process/ partition event.

		<!-- Test Procedure -->
		<testprocedure repeat="1">
      <teststep id="0" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Get the current time, sleep for one tick, get the time again and
            measure the difference. Must be equal to 1 for at least 19 times.
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="1" partition="1" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Call SET_MODULE_SCHEDULE for schedule 1, and check that 
            INVALID_CONFIG is returned, for operation not allowed.
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="2" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Check that the last step differs (MTF - P0) ticks execution window
            from the previously stored value.
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="3" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Call SET_MODULE_CHANGE for schedule "alternative_sched".
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="4" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Get the current time, sleep for one tick, get the time again and 
            measure the difference. Must be equal to 1 for at least 19 times 
            (the same value as before), since the schedule change only takes 
            effect in the next MTF
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="5" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Get the current time, and check that it differs MTF from 
            previously stored value.
        </description>
      </teststep>
      <teststep id="6" partition="0" repeat="1">
        <description>
            Get the current time, sleep for one tick, get the time again and 
            measure the difference. Must be equal to 1 for at least 9 times 
            (the value from the new schedule).
