A non Driver Manager GRETH driver is located in libchip/network/greth.c. This
version requires the driver manager.

network_interface_add is used to assign IP/NETMASK and MAC address to
GRETH interfaces dynamically according to in which order devices are
registered. The function takes the settings from the user defined
interface_configs[] array, defined in the project configuration.
