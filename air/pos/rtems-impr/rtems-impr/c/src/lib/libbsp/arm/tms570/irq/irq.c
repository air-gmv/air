     * on exit from interrupt working correctly, vim_vec cannot point
     * directly to individual vector handlers and need to point
     * to single entry path. But if TMS570_VIM.IRQINDEX is then used
     * to target execution to corresponding service then for some
     * peripherals (i.e. EMAC) interrupt is already acknowledged
     * by VIM and IRQINDEX is read as zero which leads to spurious
     * interrupt and peripheral not serviced/blocked.
     *
     * To analyze this behavior we used trampolines which setup
     * bsp_interrupt_vector_inject and pass execution to
     * _ARMV4_Exception_interrupt. It works but is more ugly than
     * use of POM remap for these cases where application does not
     * start at address 0x00000000. If RTEMS image is placed at
     * memory space beginning then no of these constructs is necessary.
