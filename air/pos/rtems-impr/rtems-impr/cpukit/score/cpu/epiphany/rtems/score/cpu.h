 *  If this is TRUE, CPU_ALLOCATE_INTERRUPT_STACK should also be TRUE.

 * Contexts
 *
 *  Generally there are 2 types of context to save.
 *     1. Interrupt registers to save
 *     2. Task level registers to save
 *
 *  This means we have the following 3 context items:
 *     1. task level context stuff::  Context_Control
 *     2. floating point task stuff:: Context_Control_fp
 *     3. special interrupt level context :: Context_Control_interrupt
 *
 *  On some processors, it is cost-effective to save only the callee
 *  preserved registers during a task context switch.  This means
 *  that the ISR code needs to save those registers which do not
 *  persist across function calls.  It is not mandatory to make this
 *  distinctions between the caller/callee saves registers for the
 *  purpose of minimizing context saved during task switch and on interrupts.
 *  If the cost of saving extra registers is minimal, simplicity is the
 *  choice.  Save the same context on interrupt entry as for tasks in
 *  this case.
 *
 *  Additionally, if gdb is to be made aware of RTEMS tasks for this CPU, then
 *  care should be used in designing the context area.
 *
 *  On some CPUs with hardware floating point support, the Context_Control_fp
 *  structure will not be used or it simply consist of an array of a
 *  fixed number of bytes.   This is done when the floating point context
 *  is dumped by a "FP save context" type instruction and the format
 *  is not really defined by the CPU.  In this case, there is no need
 *  to figure out the exact format -- only the size.  Of course, although
 *  this is enough information for RTEMS, it is probably not enough for
 *  a debugger such as gdb.  But that is another problem.
