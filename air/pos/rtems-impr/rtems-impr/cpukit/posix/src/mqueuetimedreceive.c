/*
 *  NOTE:  The structure of the routines is identical to that of POSIX
 *         Message_queues to leave the option of having unnamed message
 *         queues at a future date.  They are currently not part of the
 *         POSIX standard but unnamed message_queues are.  This is also
 *         the reason for the apparently unnecessary tracking of
 *         the process_shared attribute.  [In addition to the fact that
 *         it would be trivial to add pshared to the mq_attr structure
 *         and have process private message queues.]
 *
 *         This code ignores the O_RDONLY/O_WRONLY/O_RDWR flag at open
 *         time.
