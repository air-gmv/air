SMP Capture Test 2

This program tests the functionality to add custom entries to
the SMP capture trace.

A simple function is wrapped inside another function that stores
the input arguments and the function's result in the capture trace
every time it is called. The function is called by a set of tasks
per CPU during the test. The tasks are linked together by semaphores
in such a way that only one task is active at any given time. At the
end of the test the data stored in the capture trace is verified to
make sure that all invocations of the traced function were stored correctly.

The test also traces clock tick interrupts. If an interrupt handler
with the name "Clock" or "clock" exists, it is assumed to be the main
clock interrupt handler. The test wraps this function with another function
that adds an entry to the trace for every clock tick.
