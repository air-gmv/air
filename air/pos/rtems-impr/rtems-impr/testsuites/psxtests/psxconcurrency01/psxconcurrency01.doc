This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  psxconcurrency01

directives:
  pthread_getconcurrency
  pthread_setconcurrency

concepts:

+ This test exercises the pthread_getconcurrency() method.
+ This test exercises the pthread_setconcurrency() method.

NOTE: These methods are of limited utility with any threading implementation
      in which kernel threads and user threads are mapped 1:1. As of POSIX
      Issue 7 (POSIX 2013), these are marked obsolete. But they are still
      required for 2008 and Open Group FACE conformance.
