# Welcome to AIR v5.6.1

AIR has a user manual that you can request by e-mailing airproduct@gmv.com

You have two ways of getting AIR
1) Download from github at https://github.com/air-gmv/air
2) AIR is intregrated in TASTE toolchain available at  https://taste.tuxfamily.org/

Below is an example on installing and using AIR.
This example is use SPARC target, if ARM read section 4.2.1 of user manual.
To install AIR after cloning from git, you should do the following:


## 1 - Install RTEMS toolchain for RTEMS 5
Execute the following:

```
git clone git://git.rtems.org/rtems-source-builder.git rsb
cd rsb
./source-builder/sb-check
cd rtems
../source-builder/sb-set-builder --prefix=/opt/rtems/5 5/rtems-sparc
```

Currently supported toolchain version : rtems-5.1-2019.07.25


## 2 - Configure and build AIR
AIR configure requires python-mako, if not installed execute (in case of Debian)

    sudo apt-get install python-mako
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    sudo apt install python3-venv

Clone AIR repo for example in */home/taste/work/*


Add the *air_repo/air* to the PATH env variable, we recommend doing the following way in .bashrc file:

    export AIR=/home/taste/work/AIR/air
    export PATH=$PATH:$AIR

    git clone https://github.com/air-gmv/air.git
RTEMS 5 tool chain should be in the PATH, e.g:
    `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rtems/5/bin` 

Board support package available depend from the chosen architecture:
- SPARC   
    -  laysim_gr740 
    - leon4    
    - leon3_or_tsim2 
    - tsim 
- ARM  
    - zynqz1

Floating Point Unit option can be enabled/disabled. 

AIR supports the following paravirtualized RTOS versions:
- RTEMS 4.8i (Edisoft)
- RTEMS 5
- POSIX RTEMS 5
- BARE OS (Metal-bare)

AIR paravirtualized RTOS and AIR GUI are obtained via git submodules. For example to use AIR 
RTEMS 5 version and AIR GUI please execute in root folder of the repository.

    git submodule init air/pos/rtems5
    git submodule init air/tools/air-gui
    git submodule update


## 3 - Using AIR configurator tool

Do the following step:
On *air_repo/air* execute

    ./configure 

Alternatively an alfa version is available of AIR GUI, by executing On *air_repo/air/tools/air-gui/* :
    ./launch.sh



Configurator interface will enquire the user for options (architecture, BSP, FPU, Cache, Debugger, RTOS). For example

* Press 0 for sparc 
* Press 2 for leon4
* Press 0 for fpu enabled
* Press 0 for GRMON
* Press 1 to install all RTOS

After configurator finishes execute:

```
make clean
make
```

## 4- Build an example ready to run on a target board
Go to any example inside *air_repo/air/examples*

Execute

    ../../configure

This generate the makefiles taking as input the XML configuration file.

It generates a parent makefile and then a makefile per partition inside the respective partition folder.
 
Executing

    make all

will create the respective binary in the created *executables* folder.


## 5 - Updating AIR repo to AIR v5.6.1 and configurator v4.4
Since configurator v4.3 the RTOS paravirtualized versions are obtained via git submodules.
Pulling new AIR content into old AIR repo will generate conflicts. To get a new clean
AIR repo please execute (please backup any working folder)

    git fetch
    git reset origin/master --hard
